  * Dropdown box with all personal lightboxes

  * Automatically detects if you are inside a lightbox and auto-selects the corresponding entry in the dropdown

  * Add/Remove all buttons for easy management of the whole page

  * Toggle controls button for showing single-click per-file controls. Very easy to add/remove a file with +/- buttons. (NOTE: Click hide and then show if you move to a different search page)

  * Go to LB button allowing the user to visit any lightbox easily

  * Single-click add a single file. Works in file closeup page and file edit page (yes, now you can add files to lightboxes even before inspect)
